This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

- git remote add [Your name to represent Gerald's Forked Repo on your local machine] [The url for Gerald's Forked Repo]
- git fetch [same forked name represented above (not the url)]
- git checkout -b [Your name for Gerald's branch] [Geralds GitHub username/the name of Gerald's branch that you want to fetch]

Example: If Sally were cloning Gerald's fork

- git remote add sally-fork https://github.com/ghendrix-git/healthy-games-for-healthy-people-and-healthy-planet.git
- git fetch sally-fork
- git checkout -b sally-branch sally-fork/initial-commit

Then, run npm install

With the code on you local machine navagate to the branches root directory.

Run the development server:

```bash

npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000/home](http://localhost:3000/home) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `food_app/pages/home.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
