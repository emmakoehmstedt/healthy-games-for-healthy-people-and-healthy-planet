(Project is still in testing)

Project Description:

A food calculator intended to be used by children in order to teach nutrition and climate advocacy. A user enters the food ingredients of a meal and calculates the carbon footprint, water footprint, and the nutrition score.



How to use:

Navigate to https://capstone-deployment-test-topaz.vercel.app/
User is presented with a home page. Click on the “Calculator” button to navigate to the food selection page.
The user clicks on the “+” button of the foods the user would like to add.
After the user has added all the foods they would like to put in their meal, the user can click the “calculate” button to be taken to the results page.
The user can now see their result and edit the serving sizes of their ingredients.
The user can press the “Back” or “New Calculation” buttons to be taken back to the previous page or the “Home” button to go home.
