# 2. Project Overview
Games for Healthy People & Healthy Planet aims to teach how children engage with their food consumption habits, promoting sustainability and health awareness. The application provides a user-friendly interface where individuals can track their food choices, explore nutritional information, and evaluate the environmental impact of their dietary decisions. Games for Healthy People & Healthy Planet represents a holistic approach to fostering healthier, more sustainable lifestyles. Through its intuitive interface and comprehensive features, the platform empowers children to make informed decisions that contribute to their well-being and the health of the planet.

# 3. Technologies Used
[List the technologies, frameworks, libraries, and tools used in the project.]

## Frontend
- ### Prototype - Figma
- ### React

## Backend

## Database
- ### Supabase

## Deployment 
- ### Vercel

# 4. Development Environment Setup
[Provide instructions on setting up the development environment, including installation steps for required software, dependencies, and configuration.]
## Getting Started

git clone [github url] <br>
git pull origin main <br>
git checkout -b [Your name for a new branch]
> [!NOTE]
> the purpose of git pull origin main is to get the latest updated files on the remote main branch

Example: If Sally was cloning the development to her local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/emmakoehmstedt/healthy-games-for-healthy-people-and-healthy-planet.git
git pull origin main
git checkout -b sally-branch
```

Then, run npm install
```bash
npm install
```

With the code on you local machine navigate to the branches root directory.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/home](http://localhost:3000/home) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `food_app/pages/home.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
