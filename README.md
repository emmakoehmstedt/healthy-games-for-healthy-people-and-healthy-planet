The docs/ directory will hold a standalone Starlight + Astro website.

The src/ directory will contain our codebase

The wip/ directory is the Work in Progress directory. It contains assignment templates that will be modified/updated during the year. 

The LICENSE is currently CC0 and will need to be changed by the end of the year.

**General Rules**
- Never create issues directly, do it through the Board created in the github-projects tab
- Backlog is all issues for the project, to-do is what issues are ready to be worked on (will be assigned to individuals), in-progress is what individuals are currently working on, in-review is what needs to be reviewed by others, and completed is completed issues.
- Always add a description when you create an issue within the board
