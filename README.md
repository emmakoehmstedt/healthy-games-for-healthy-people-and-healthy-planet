# Project Structure

**General Rules**
- Never create issues directly, do it through the Board created in the github-projects tab
- Backlog is all issues for the project, to-do is what issues are ready to be worked on (will be assigned to individuals), in-progress is what individuals are currently working on, in-review is what needs to be reviewed by others, and completed is completed issues.
- Always add a description when you create an issue within the board
